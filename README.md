**IXROBOTICS**
Welcome to the IXROBOTICS project repository. This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of the preliminary work, demonstrations, and sketches that were meticulously developed prior to the implementation of the actual parts and components of our robotic system. Our work in this project encompasses a wide range of preparatory tasks, including conceptual designs, technical drawings, and early prototypes, all of which played a crucial role in shaping the final build of our robot and its communication system.

In addition to the visual and descriptive documentation, you will also find a CSV file that meticulously records the handling and management of various parts used throughout the project. This file serves as a detailed log, providing insights into the components' lifecycle from acquisition to integration within the system. Each entry includes information such as part identification, handling procedures, and implementation stages, ensuring a transparent and traceable process.

By sharing this repository, we aim to provide a clear understanding of our project's development journey, showcasing the extensive groundwork that underpins the IXROBOTICS initiative. Whether you are a fellow researcher, engineer, or enthusiast, we hope this documentation offers valuable insights and inspiration for your own projects in the field of robotics.
